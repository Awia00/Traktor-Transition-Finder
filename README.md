# TraktorAutoNextSong
A small tool for automatically finding the next song to play when DJing using Traktor Pro 2.


The tool works by creating a weighted graph of every song in a Traktor collection of songs, where the weights determine what song is best to mix into. 
The weight is calculated using the BPM of the songs and their different keys.
